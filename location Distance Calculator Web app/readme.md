# Shiny Web App: Distance Locator

Welcome to the Distance Locator web app repository! This project leverages Shiny for Python to create an interactive web application that calculates distances between airports. The app includes all airports in Pakistan and international airports worldwide. Key features of this app include:

1. **Basic Setup**: Setting up Shiny for Python and creating the distance locator app.
2. **Data Integration**: Incorporating data for all airports in Pakistan and international airports worldwide.
3. **User Interface Design**: Designing a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and use.
4. **Reactive Programming**: Implementing reactive elements to dynamically calculate distances based on user input.
5. **Geospatial Data Handling**: Utilizing geospatial libraries to manage and process airport location data.
6. **Distance Calculation**: Implementing algorithms to accurately calculate distances between selected airports.
7. **Interactive Maps**: Integrating maps to visualize airport locations and flight paths.
8. **Interactive Widgets**: Using Shiny widgets to allow users to select airports and view distance information.
9. **Server Logic**: Writing server logic to handle data processing and distance calculations in real-time.
10. **Deployment**: Deploying the Shiny app on a suitable platform for public access.
11. **Advanced Features**: Exploring advanced features like custom CSS, JavaScript, and enhancing functionality with additional Python libraries.

This Shiny web app project aims to provide a practical example of how to use Shiny for Python to build a robust and interactive distance locator tool. Whether you are interested in geospatial data or looking to enhance your web development skills with Shiny, this project offers valuable insights and exercises to guide your learning.
